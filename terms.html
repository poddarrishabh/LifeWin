<ul>
<li><p>6.1 Payment and Invoicing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>6.1.1 Payment for using lifewin PRO Accounts is made in accordance with the invoicing conditions selected by you. The price and discounts that apply and are accepted by all parties at the moment of transaction are indicated at: <a href="/pro">www.lifewin.co/pro</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>6.1.2 Prices of applications of third-party providers or external developers are determined explicitly by them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>6.1.3 Charges are due at the beginning of each invoicing period. If you have a subscription, it will renew automatically until you cancel. Every further payment will be due at the beginning of the new payment cycle.</p>
</li>
<li><p>6.1.4 All charges and prices stated include the applicable value added tax.</p>

</li>
<li><p>6.2.3 We reserve the right to assert further claims for default of payment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Term of Your Licensing Agreement and Termination</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>7.1 Free Use of lifewin</p>
<ul>
<li><p>7.1.1 The agreement on free use of lifewin apps is for an indefinite period.</p>
</li>
<li><p>7.1.2 You can terminate the agreement at any time by selecting the &quot;delete your account&quot; option in the account settings, thereby deleting your account. On termination, unsecured data will be lost as we will delete your account completely. We will inform you of this again separately before we delete your account.</p>
</li>
<li><p>7.1.3 We can terminate this agreement in writing with a notice period of two (2) weeks (email will be sufficient).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>7.2 Use of PRO Accounts</p>
<ul>
<li><p>7.2.1 Depending on the PRO Account payment method, the agreement is concluded for an indefinite term or for a given fixed minimum term (&quot;Minimum Term Agreements&quot;).</p>
</li>
<li><p>7.2.2 Both parties may terminate the agreement at any time. If you change to another PRO Account category, this will not constitute termination. We will simply adapt the conditions of payment and your rights to your new PRO Account category.</p>
</li>
<li><p>7.2.3 Agreements with a minimum term will run until the end of the agreed period and will be extended automatically by the same period if you do not terminate your Account beforehand by deleting it in accordance with No. 7.1.2 or by downgrading it to free use. If you terminate or downgrade a PRO Account, the original agreements will run to the end of the agreed term and will not be renewed. Reimbursement of already-paid fees for the current term is not possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>7.3 In addition, the agreement may be terminated for just cause. Just cause, which would entitle Lifewin to terminate the agreement, would be if you breach your contractual obligations, in particular the rules of use described in Section 3.6 or if you are delayed with your payment obligations in accordance with Section 6.2.1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Liability for Defects</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>8.1 We are only liable for defects in lifewin in accordance with Section 8 provided the impairments are not due to the restrictions in availability (SLA) described in Section 2.4.</p>
</li>
<li><p>8.2 A defect will always be deemed to exist if the suitability for contractual use is suspended or considerably restricted. If suitability for contractual use is suspended in full, you will be released from paying your charges in accordance with No. 6 until the defect is corrected. If use is partially available, the charges will be reduced to an appropriate level for the period until the defect is corrected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>8.3 You must inform us of the defect in writing or by email immediately.</p>
</li>
<li><p>8.4 You are not entitled to damages due to a defect to lifewin due to a circumstance for which we are not responsible, either existing when you sign the agreement or occurring thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>8.5 Further claims and rights for defects to lifewin—other than those explicitly named in No. 8—will not be recognized except if we are held liable for them by statutory provisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Liability</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>9.1 Free Use of lifewin<br> Our liability for use of the free lifewin product is restricted to intention and gross negligence or the absence of a guaranteed characteristic. We will be fully liable in cases of intention; in cases of gross negligence and the absence of a guaranteed feature, our liability will be restricted to typical and foreseeable damage. Any further liability is excluded.</p>
</li>
<li><p>9.2 Use of the PRO Accounts for Payment <br> We will be liable as follows for use of PRO Accounts made available against payment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>9.2.1 Claims by users for compensation will not be recognized. Exceptions are: damages claimed by users for death, physical injury, harm to human health, the breach of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) or liability for other damage resulting from an intently or grossly negligent breach of duty on our part, our legal representatives or assistants. Cardinal obligations within the meaning of these Terms and Conditions are those obligations that make the due performance of this agreement and the achievement of its objectives possible in the first place, and on the regular compliance of which the user may therefore rely.</p>
</li>
<li><p>9.2.2 Where essential contractual obligations are violated, we will only be liable for the foreseeable damage typical to agreements of this nature if the damage were merely caused negligently, unless the damage claims by the user refer to cases of death or injury to body or health.</p>
</li>
<li><p>9.2.3 Claims in accordance with the German Product Liability Act will remain unaffected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>9.2.4 The restrictions of Sections 9.2.1 and 9.2.2 will also apply in favor of our legal representatives and assistants if claims are asserted against these parties directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Miscellaneous: Final Provisions and Amendments to the Terms and Conditions of Use</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>10.1 This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
</li>
<li><p>10.2 If you have no place of jurisdiction in Germany or in any other EU member state, if you have transferred your permanent domicile abroad after these Terms of Use take effect or if your domicile or usual place of residence is unknown at the time legal action is taken, the sole place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this agreement will be the location of our registered offices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>10.3 Should individual provisions of these Terms of Use be or become invalid and/or contrary to the statutory provisions, this will not affect the validity remaining Terms of Use. In place of the invalid, unenforceable term, the Parties shall mutually agree on such valid commercial terms which the Parties would reasonably have agreed otherwise. The above-mentioned provision will apply correspondingly in the case of omissions in these provisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>10.4 We reserve the right to amend and adapt these Terms and Conditions with effect for the future. You can request the currently applicable version of the Terms of Use via <a href="mailto:contact@lifewin.com" data-track="Mailto:Support Contact:Terms Of Use">contact@lifewin.com</a> or access them at <a href="http://www.lifewin.co/terms.html">www.lifewin.co/terms-of-use</a>. You will be notified by email no later than one month before new Terms and Confitions take effect. If you do not object to the validity of the new Terms of Use within one month after they take effect, you will be deemed to have accepted the new Terms of Use. We will inform you separately in suitable form about the significance of the one month&#39;s notice period, your right to object and the legal consequences of non-objection. This amendment mechanism does not apply to amendments to the parties&#39; main contractual obligations.</p>
